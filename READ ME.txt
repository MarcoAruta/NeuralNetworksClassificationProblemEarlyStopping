Algorithm for C-class classification problem resolution using the mnist dataset as input.
Implementation of forward propagation, back propagation and resilient back propagation algorithms.
Study of the neural network learning process, using a single layer of internal nodes and the sigmoid
as activation function when the early stopping criterion changes. These criterion are based on
this scientific paper: "Early Stopping, but when? Lutz Prechelt, 1999".
In this project two main early stopping algorithms have been considered: GL and PQ.
